# github-battle-hooks
After the refactor, this is Github battle with hooks

THIS CODE IS NOT MINE. Tyler McGinnis (https://github.com/tylermcginnis) has an excellent course on React that I followed along with to generate this file. The concepts are explained in detail, and as my profile becomes more fleshed out with React projects of my own you will start to see these concepts reflected in my work.

However, every concept listed in here has a point of reference for me - it's something I've been exposed to, and can quickly retrace my steps to figure out the how and why on each line of code.
